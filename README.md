Loxee
=====

A lockscreen replacement that takes and emails photos of unauthorised users.

###	Quick Start

Before you open Loxee, you need to open Settings.exe and set a few important settings. You'll need to put in an email address and choose a password, select whether you're using an inbuilt or custom background image, and select an image. Then you're ready to start using Loxee: press OK to save your settings.



###	Don't have an inbuilt webcam?

Loxee will still do the job of locking your computer, but obviously won't be able to take any photos of the intruder. Loxee will work with most USB webcams without configuration if you choose to plug one in.



###	Using keyboard shortcuts

You can start Loxee with a keyboard shortcut from anywhere on your computer. To set one up, you'll first need to make a shortcut to Loxee. Right-click on Loxee.exe, hover over 'Send to' and click on Desktop (create shortcut). Find this shortcut on the desktop and right-click it. Click 'Properties' in the context menu that appears. In the 'Shortcut' tab, click the textbox next to 'Shortcut key:' and press your desired shortcut key on the keyboard. The textbox contents should now show 'CTRL+ALT+[key]'. All you need to do is press this key combination at any time and your computer will be locked. You can now move the shortcut from your desktop if you want, but don't delete it because the keyboard shortcut will no longer work.



###	Troubleshooting

Bug reports should be submitted on GitHub. Loxee will only be able to send emails if you have a data connection, WiFi or otherwise. If you don't, Loxee will take photos but not send them, and they will instead be stored in the same directory as Loxee.



###	Solutions to common issues

Make sure your webcam privacy shade is open.
Update your webcam's drivers.
Check https://mail.google.com isn't blocked by your internet provider or any subsequent filters (for instance by your school).
Make sure you have a solid internet connection.



###	Enjoy!

Keep your computer secure - having Loxee installed offers no guarantee that you will get a picture of the thief, and having a picture is not necessarily proof that they have your computer. If you used Loxee and lost your computer, I am in no way responsible!
